/*
 * A pixmap is a three-dimensional array of bits stored somewhere offscreen,
 * rather than in the visible portion of the screenâ€™s display frame buffer.
 * It can be used as a source or destination in graphics operations.
 * There is no implied interpretation of the pixel values in a pixmap,
 * because it has no associated visual or colormap. There is only a depth
 * that indicates the number of significant bits per pixel. Also, there is
 * no implied physical size for each pixel; all graphic units are in numbers
 * of pixels. Therefore, a pixmap alone does not constitute a complete image;
 * it represents only a rectangular array of pixel values.
